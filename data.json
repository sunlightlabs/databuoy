          "description":"In fiscal year 2012, USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) awarded funding to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to design and implement a multi-year Title II development food assistance program in Niger. The main purpose of the Title II program is to improve long-term food security of chronically food insecure population in the target regions. FFP contracted a firm, ICF International to conduct a baseline study in targeted areas of the country prior to the start of the new program.  The purpose of the study was to assess the current status of key indicators, have a better understanding of prevailing conditions and perceptions of the population in the implementation areas, and serve as a point of comparison for future final evaluations.  Results would also be used to further refine program targeting and, where possible, to understand the relationship between variables to inform program design.  The study was conducted in 2013, while FFP expects to conduct final evaluations as close as possible to the end of the program five years later.",

Whether it's getting working capital to promising entrepreneurs or input financing to small farmers, DCA seeks to prove the commercial viability of underserved markets so that lending and investment continues long after we exit. The Development Credit Authority (DCA) uses partial credit guarantees to mobilize local financing in developing countries. Guarantee agreements encourage private lenders to extend financing to underserved borrowers in new sectors and regions. By opening up local channels of financing, USAID is empowering entrepreneurs in developing countries at a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer. This USAID dataset shows the partial credit guarantees that USAID has issued since the development credit authority program was founded in 1999. The spreadsheet reflects the full facility size of each guarantee, how much was lent under the guarantee, the status of the guarantee (i.e., active or expired), how much in claims the bank submitted due to losses it incurred for loans placed under the guarantee, and how many loans were placed under coverage of the guarantee. The data also shows the sector and country for each guarantee.",

It is the first tool of its kind. Piloted in 2011 and launched in February 2012, the US government is using the index to track change in women's empowerment that occurs as a direct or indirect result of Feed the Future interventions in targeted geographic zones within the initiative's 19 focus countries. Data for the WEAI will be collected every two years in all 19 countries, and baselines were collected in 2011 and 2012. USAID and partners will conduct data analyses to understand the relationships among empowerment, livelihoods, and food security, as well as relationships among the various components of the index. Feed the Future will also use the WEAI for impact evaluations of distinct projects to examine the effectiveness of different approaches and how they impact women and men. To protect the personal information of respondents, all personal identifiable information was removed.",

Second, it translates TraiNet data to the format required by SEVIS and manages its transmission. Lastly, it provides approval management of requests for applications as they move through the workflow process. VCS holds data regarding foreign nationals who receive instruction funded by USAID, whose training will take place in the United States, and to request a J-1 visa for travel to the United States.",

EODS provides an automated on-boarding process that focuses on pre-employment on-boarding benefits forms completion and data collection and delivery of new hire information to prospective federal employee. The system pulls position data from HR Connect . The public-facing Internet portion allows EODS applicants to access their information via a secure connection across the internet. The intranet portion allows HR Specialists to administer and track applicants' benefits package completion and the interconnection between EODS and HR Connect.  CareerLauncher is the entry-on-duty system (EODS) implemented in July 2012 to help streamline the onboarding process and provide a much better experience for new hires entering the Agency. This system greatly reduces the manual effort for new hires by providing the package of standard forms that a new hire typically completes by hand in electronic form via the internet, with some prefilled information provided by the applicant from Monster CareerConnector. In addition, the system greatly reduces the data entry on the HR professional's part by automatically feeding the new hire information to the USAID HR personnel system.",
